Hello-World
my name is Eva and I want to learn this coding stuff I only have a chrome book and hhope that will work. supposedly there a wroters as somple as google docs that I can use but how do I write something and test it out. Like say I was making an app how does that even work or do I need a different platform to write code to create an app. I suppose I am going to start with IT Certifications and work my way from there.
